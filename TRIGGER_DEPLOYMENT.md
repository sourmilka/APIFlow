# üöÄ Trigger Vercel Deployment

**Current Status**: Deployment not found at https://api-flow-virid.vercel.app/

## Why Deployment Hasn't Started

Vercel needs to be connected to your GitHub repository first. Here's how to fix it:

---

## ‚úÖ Option 1: Import via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

### Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard
üåê **URL**: https://vercel.com/new

### Step 2: Import Repository
1. Click **"Import Git Repository"**
2. If you don't see `sourmilka/APIFlow`, click **"Adjust GitHub App Permissions"**
3. Give Vercel access to the `APIFlow` repository
4. Click **"Import"** next to `sourmilka/APIFlow`

### Step 3: Configure Project
- **Project Name**: `api-flow-virid` (or keep as `APIFlow`)
- **Framework**: Vite (auto-detected)
- **Root Directory**: `./`
- **Build Command**: `vite build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`

### Step 4: Environment Variables
Add all these variables (you said you already did this ‚úÖ):

```
NODE_ENV=production
MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
MONGODB_DB_NAME=apiflow
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-key
VITE_API_URL=https://api-flow-virid.vercel.app
```

### Step 5: Deploy
1. Click **"Deploy"**
2. Wait 2-3 minutes
3. ‚úÖ Live!

---

## ‚úÖ Option 2: Redeploy Existing Project

If you already imported the project but it's not deployed:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your `api-flow-virid` project
3. Click on it
4. Go to **"Deployments"** tab
5. Click **"Redeploy"** on the latest deployment

---

## ‚úÖ Option 3: Push a Small Change to Trigger Auto-Deploy

If the repository is connected but not deploying:

```bash
# Make a small change to trigger deployment
echo "# Deployment triggered" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Trigger Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

This will trigger an automatic deployment.

## üîç Check Deployment Status

After triggering deployment, check these:

1. **Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Your Project**: Look for `api-flow-virid` or `APIFlow`
3. **Deployment Logs**: Click on the deployment to see build logs
4. **Live URL**: Should be at https://api-flow-virid.vercel.app/

---

## ‚úÖ What to Check After Deployment

1. **Homepage**: https://api-flow-virid.vercel.app/
2. **Health Check**: https://api-flow-virid.vercel.app/api/health
3. **Test Parsing**: Try parsing `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`
